	abstract = {This anthology of essays from Donald Knuth, "the father of computer science," and the inventor of literate programming includes early essays on related topics such as structured programming, as well as The Computer Journal article that launched literate programming itself. Many examples are given, including excerpts from the programs for TeX and METAFONT. The final essay is an example of CWEB, a system for literate programming in C and related languages.This volume is first in a series of Knuth's collected works.},

	abstract = {The proliferation of large, complex spatial data sets presents challenges to the way that regional science and geography more widely is researched and taught. Increasingly, it is not ‘just’ quantitative skills that are needed, but computational ones. However, the majority of undergraduate programmes have yet to oﬀer much more than a one oﬀ ‘GIS programming’ class since such courses are seen as challenging not only for students to take, but for staﬀ to deliver. Using the evaluation criterion of minimal complexity, maximal ﬂexibility, interactivity, utility, and maintainability, we show how the technical features of Jupyter notebooks particularly when combined with the popularity of Anaconda Python and Docker enabled us to develop and deliver a suite of three ‘geocomputation’ modules to Geography undergraduates, with some progressing to data science and analytics roles.},
